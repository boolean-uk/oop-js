# Inheritance

A feature of object-oriented languages is the ability to share behaviour. Primarily a tool to help
deal with complexity, sharing behaviour allows for smaller, modular groups of behaviour to be designed that can
then be shared.

Parent class <-> Child class (inherits properties and methods)


### Instructions

- [ ] Move shared behaviour into an `Animal` class as a parent class for `Cat` and `Dog`
- [ ] Update the tests accordingly
- [ ] Then, instead of using inheritance, compose the Cat and Dog classes by passing the class of shared behaviour as an argument to their constructor functions.
