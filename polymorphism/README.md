# Polymorphism

### Quickstart
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Run tests
```sh
$ npx jasmine
$ npx eslint src --fix # lint your src directory and automatically fix errors
```

### Instructions
- [ ] Run the tests and use the error messages to complete the program first
- [ ] Then refactor the `Race` class behaviour in `src/race.js` to reduce the coupling of `Race` to `Car`, `Plane`, and `Skateboard`
- [ ] Then consider how to decouple your tests from the classes used. Your tests should pass when complete.

### Further work

- [ ] What are the advantages and disadvantages to polymorphism?
